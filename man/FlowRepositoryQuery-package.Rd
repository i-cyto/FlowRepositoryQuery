\description{
The \code{FlowRepositoryQuery} package provides a comprehensive listing of
all experiments deposited in the FlowRepository as of 2024-08-01. User also have access to a
web interface that allows to easily query experiments based on their interested markers.
}
\details{
FlowRepository is a database of flow cytometry experiments where you can query and
download data collected and annotated according to the MIFlowCyt standard.
It is primarily used as a data deposition place for experimental findings published
in peer-reviewed journals in the flow cytometry field.

The user can search for a marker name or regular expression separated by comma, space, pipe or line breaks.
The output is not case-sensitive and the corresponding markers are displayed below with their different matches.
The user will then be allowed to download a corresponding excel file.

#
# cd4,cd25,cd127,fox.*p3    # will let user access the 80 experiments
#                           # with these four associated markers.
#
## For complex marker names user is able to use regex annotation:
#
# t[-_]*bet          # finds all the different strings associated with T-bet
#                    # i.e. T-bet(72), Tbet(55) and all the names associated
#                    # with this marker with their florochromes/metals.
#
# pd.*l.*1           # finds markers associated with PD-L1.
#                    # i.e. PD-L1(34), PDL1(16) or even PDL.1(1)
