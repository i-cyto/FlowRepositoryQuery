<h3 class="western">Context</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://flowrepository.org/">FlowRepository</a> is an important resource for the community. It contains a large number of public experiments that could be useful for improving analytical pipelines, as external experiments to validate results, or as a source of hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
    To improve analytical pipelines, I'd like to identify experiments and add tags to announce when an experiment could be a standard for developing or validating one of the steps in the pipeline. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to browse and filter the information presented on the FR public page.
</p>
<p>
    I have therefore analyzed the FR public pages, collected information, and compiled it into a table. This table is available in the form of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qn1K2usdhI1wMEagrTcWWhsFMWEDwy2HG2WykMT0KPY" target="_blank">Google sheet</a>, which could make it easier to access the information. There is a ‘dictionary’ tab to explain the columns reported and their origin.
</p>
<p>
    There is an interesting column entitled "Design". It summarizes the experimental design of an experiment when it is provided by the researcher. It lists each factor (sample types, time points, tissues, etc.), its values, and the number of SCFs per value. This will help me a lot in selecting a clearly defined design. Unfortunately, I know of experiments whose design has not been annotated in FR, which hinders the reuse of experiments and, perhaps, the development of FR.
</p>
<p>
    The experiment metadata was collected on 2024-08-01. There are 2133 experiments, about 413k FCS files for a total volume of about 5 TB.
