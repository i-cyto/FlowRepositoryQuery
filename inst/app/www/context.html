Context</h3>
<p style="line-height: 115%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><a href="http://flowrepository.org/">FlowRepository</a>
is an important resource for the community. It contains a large
number of public experiments that could be useful for improving
analytical pipelines, as external experiments to validate results or
as a source of hypotheses.<br/>
<br/>
To improve analytical
pipelines, I'd like to identify experiments and add tags to announce
when an experiment could be a standard for developing or validating
one of the steps in the pipeline. Unfortunately, it's very difficult?
to browse and filter the information presented on the FR public page.
I have therefore analysed the FR public pages, collected information
and compiled it into a table. This table is available in the form of
a Google sheet, which could make it easier to access the information.
There is a ‘dictionary’ tab to explain the columns reported and
their origin.<br/>
<br/>
If you simply wish to consult these data,
please browse or download the Google Sheet

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There
is an interesting column entitled Design. It summarises the
experimental design of an experiment when it is provided by the
researcher. It lists each factor (sample types, time points, tissues,
etc.), its values and the number of SCFs per value. This will help me
a lot in selecting a clearly defined design. Unfortunately, I know of
experiments whose design has not been annotated in FR, which hinders
the re-use of experiments and, perhaps, the development of FR.<br/>
<br/>
The
experiment metadata was collected on 2024-08-01. There are 2133
experiments, about 413 k FCS files for a total volume of about 5 TB.<br/>
