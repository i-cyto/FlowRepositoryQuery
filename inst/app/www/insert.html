<p>
  The current tool aims to make it easier to search
<a href="http://flowrepository.org/">FlowRepository's</a>
  public experiments by panel markers.
          Filtering the panel column is not easy without a regular
          expression because the names of the markers are not really standardised by humans.
  You can enter one or more markers, separated by commas or line breaks. 


<b>When searching for multiple markers, the filtered experiments will necessarily contain all of them.</b>
