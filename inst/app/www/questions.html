    <div class="faq-question">Why are some experiments listed multiple times in the resulting Excel file?

    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The query tool targets marker names through the panel column. As a result, an experiment may be listed multiple times if it contains multiple panels. In many cases, the panels are nearly identical except for one marker.</p>

    <div class="faq-question">Would it be possible to include species and tissue information in the resulting Excel file? 
      <span class="arrow">&#xf107;</span>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The information regarding species is sometimes included in the keywords, but it is not consistently placed in a designated field. Additionally, some experiments involve multiple species, such as human and macaque, or mouse and human. To the best of our knowledge, species and tissue information is not mandatory upon submission and should be linked to the FCS files.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, species and tissue data should ideally be based on ontologies. For species, the NCBI taxonomy would be a good reference point. This could be more reliable than relying on free-text entries. For instance, searching for "human" may inadvertently retrieve "non-human primates" as well.</p>

    The file available for download is prefixed with "fr240801", but this does not reflect today's date.

    <p>
      The prefix in the downloaded Excel file name corresponds to the date when the data was extracted from FlowRepository, rather than the current date.
