    The current tool aims to make it easier to search FlowRepository's public experiments by panel markers. Filtering the panel column is not easy without a regular expression because the names of the markers are not really standardized by humans.

    CD3 is not CD33, even though CD33 contains CD3. You therefore need to search for words rather than strings of characters, as shown in the illustration below.

    You can enter several markers at once, and they will all be present in the resulting selection of experiments.

    PD-L1 has many spellings, as does PD1. Therefore, the search must include wildcards to match separators such as '-', '_' or even '.'. This is the role of '.', which symbolizes the wildcard character.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the query 'PD.L1' will find 'PD-L1', 'PD_L1', but also 'PDXL1'. The latter is not relevant but could be easily removed. The most important thing is probably not to miss any writing. If the possible characters are known, they can be listed, for example, 'PD[-_.]L1' for 'PD-L1', 'PD_L1', or 'PD.L1'.
</p>
<p>
    Postfixing a character or a sequence with '*' indicates that it may or may not be present. For example, 'PD[-_.]*L1' will also match 'PDL1'. You probably know enough to enjoy regular expressions for finding markers.
