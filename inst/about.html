current tool aims to make it easier to search FlowRepository's public
experiments by panel markers. Filtering the panel column is not easy
without a regular expression because the names of the markers are not
really standardised by humans.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 115%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">CD3 is not CD33, even though CD33 contains CD3. You therefore need to search for words rather than strings of characters, as shown in the illustration below.<br/><br/>

    You can enter several markers at once, and they will all be present in
the resulting selection of experiments. </font>

PD-L1 has many spellings, as does PD1. Therefore, the search must include
wildcards to match separators such as '-', '_' or even '.'. This is
the role of '.', which symbolises the wildcard character. 

For example, the query 'PD.L1' will find 'PD-L1', 'PD_L1', but also
'PDXL1'. The latter is not relevant but could be easily removed. The
most important thing is probably not to miss any writing. If the
possible characters are known, they can be listed, for example
'PD[-_.]L1' for 'PD-L1', 'PD_L1' or 'PD.L1'. 

Postfixing a character or a sequence with '*' indicates that it may or may not be present.
For example 'PD[-_.]*L1' will also match 'PDL1'. You probably know
enough to enjoy regular expressions for finding markers.<br/><br/>
